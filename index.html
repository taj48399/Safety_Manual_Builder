                    <li><strong>Suspension or Demotion:</strong> For certain offenses, suspension without pay (up to a specified maximum) or demotion may be considered as alternatives to termination.</li>
                    <li><strong>Termination:</strong> Dismissal may occur for continued misconduct, failure to improve, or in cases of gross misconduct (e.g., theft, violence, serious safety violations).
